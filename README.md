#### These are my dotfiles for Unix systems.

I don't customize my tools heavily. Instead, **I tend to lean toward sensible defaults where ever possible.**

The result is an enviroment that behaves exactly as expected, but has a few more features that make life easier. It is never surprising, and it never gets in the way.

If you would like to use this enviroment, I'd recommend starting with a _clean slate_ using the most recent version of [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) or [OSX](http://www.apple.com/osx/), installing the below software, and then running the install script included in these dotfiles.


#### Arch

- window manager - [i3](http://i3wm.org/)
- terminal - [urxvt](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html)
- editor - [vim](http://www.vim.org/)
- version control - [git](http://git-scm.com/)
- browser - [firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- launcher - [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/)

#### OSX

- terminal - [terminal.app](http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/all.html#terminal)
- editor - [sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
- version control - [git](http://git-scm.com/)
- browser - [firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- launcher - [alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)
